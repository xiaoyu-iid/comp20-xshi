Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.

	I believe that all aspects are correctly implemented.

Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.

	Nobody. However I was inspired by Ming Chow's talk at DEFCON on NoSQL injections, and I manipulated and updated Gabe Joseph & GitHub's markdown CSS (https://gist.github.com/andyferra/2554919) to style the index page.

Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.

	Five hours. I really need dinner.
