Assignment 2: Closest MBTA Station
By: Xiaoyu Shi
Date: Oct. 20, 2016

Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.

	All aspects, including displaying the Googlemap, rendering station and user location,
	rendering the polylines, are correctly implemented.

	Two occurrances to take note of:
		1. If the JSON file is not correctly opened, the webpage will refresh itself until
	the file is read correctly.
		2. The fact that I applied for a new Googlemap API key does not solve the problem of
	Googlemap API warning (NoApiKeys). Although warnings are acceptable, I suspect that it might
	be the problem that I refreshed the page too many times???

Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.

	Not really anyone, except a few Piazza posts.

Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.
	
	Approximately 15 hours? I honestly do not remember.
